"The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to as "
"GRASS, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) providing powerful raster, "
"vector, and geospatial processing engines in a single integrated software "
"suite. GRASS GIS includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of "
"raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the "
"processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It comes with a temporal "
"framework for advanced time series processing and a Python API for rapid "
"geospatial programming. GRASS GIS has been optimized for performance and "
"large geospatial data analysis. It also can produce sophisticated "
"presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS GIS has been translated into "
"many languages and supports a huge array of data formats."

"The GRASS GIS software includes more than 400 built-in analysis modules. "
"Additionally, over 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes are "
"available for free from the Add-on repository. After more than 30 years of "
"continuous development GRASS GIS is both the longest maintained and largest "
"Open Source GIS available. It is easily scriptable and versatile enough to "
"be used both for batch data processing on massively-parallel supercomputers "
"as well as a handy desktop GIS for handheld PDAs or netbooks."
