"ORFEO Toolbox Library (OTB) is a high performance image processing library. "
"It is primarily used for processing large remote sensing images such as "
"those gathered by radars, satellites and aerial photography. OTB provides "
"tools for optic and radar images (tridimensional aspects, segmentation, "
"classification, changes detection, texture analysis, pattern matching, and "
"optic/radar complementarities), many of which can be run on limited-"
"resourced laptops."
