"Users can accomplish a broad array of tasks such as: image classification, "
"statistical analysis to infer spatial relationships and patterns of "
"features, and others listed in the core features below. The functions "
"available via R complement and advance capabilities found in GIS and image "
"processing software. Using packages for parallelisation users can "
"drastically reduce computational time and increase these capability. Several"
" packages provide connection with other OSGeo tools and software. You can "
"easily plug R with GRASS-GIS, Qgis, postgreSQL and postGIS."
