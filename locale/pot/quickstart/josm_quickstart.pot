In OpenStreetMap there is special terminology which you will come to learn as you progress. In OSM, points are actually called **nodes**, and lines are called **ways**. A shape is called a **closed way** because it is just a line that ends at the same point where it begins."

Tags are information that is tied to a point, line or shape that describes what it is. We’ll learn more about tags in a later chapter. For now all you need to know is that this information helps describe whether our object is a forest, a river, a building, or something else."
