msgid "Rasdaman is a Big Data Engine for flexible ad-hoc analytics on multi-dimensional spatio-temporal sensor, image, simulation, and statistics data of unlimited size. The Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) query language is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard wich allows filtering and processing of multi-dimensional raster coverages, such as sensor, simulation, image, and statistics data using web services. The WCPS queries are translated to rasdaman query language, rasql, and are executed on rasdaman. This quick start shows how to access and manipulate an example 2D coverage using WCPS language."
