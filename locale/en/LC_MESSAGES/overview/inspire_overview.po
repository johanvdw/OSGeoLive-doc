"The `INSPIRE Directive <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu>`__ aims to create a "
"European Union spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for the purposes of "
"environmental policies. This European SDI will enable the sharing of "
"environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, "
"facilitate public access to spatial information and assist in policy-making "
"across boundaries.  INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial "
"information established and operated by the 28 Member States of the European"
" Union. The Directive addresses 34 spatial data themes needed for "
"environmental applications.  It came into force on 15 May 2007 and will be "
"implemented in various stages, with full implementation required by 2021. "
"INSPIRE is on a technical level based on international standards, mainly "
"those developed by the :doc:`OGC <ogc_overview>` and ISO."
