"GeoMoose is a browser based mapping framework for displaying distributed "
"cartographic data. It is particularly useful for managing spatial and non-"
"spatial data within county, city and municipal offices (from which GeoMoose "

"provide built in services, like drill-down identify operations for viewing "
"and organising many layers, selection operations and dataset searches."
