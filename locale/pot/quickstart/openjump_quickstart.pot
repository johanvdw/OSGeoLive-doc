msgid "The OpenJUMP user interface has four (4) basic components as most other desktop GIS. (i) The first is a top-level menu bar for accessing most functionality. (ii) The second is a main toolbar that sits just below the menu bar. The buttons give access to the most important display and navigation functions. (iii) The third is a tree view on the left that shows the layer list of the active project. (iv) The fourth is the map view. This is the actual map where a graphical representation of the spatial data in each layer is given. Finally there is an information bar at the bottom displaying mouse pointer coordinates, processing reports, and memory usage. A project window contains a layer list and a layer view. Each instance of OpenJUMP can contain multiple projects. In our quick start, we will only be working with a single window."

This will present you with a dialog box that allows you to open files containing geospatial data. In our example, you want to browse for an ESRI shapefile. Look for a file with the .shp extension (e.g. on the LiveDVD under `/home/user/data/natural_earth2/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp`). Select the file and click the [Finish] button on the dialog. After a few moments, you will be able to see the data from your shapefile in the Map View. You will also see a new layer created for your data in the Layer List. The name of the layer will match the name of the shapefile."

If the selection worked, then the features line color should change to yellow and small yellow squares appear at each angle point (vertex) in the feature geometry."
